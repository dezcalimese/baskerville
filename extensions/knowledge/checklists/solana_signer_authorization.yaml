    question: "Can accounts be reinitialized after initial setup?"
    description: "If initialization doesn't check for prior initialization, an attacker can reinitialize with malicious parameters."
    remediation: "Use Anchor's init constraint (checks discriminator) or manually check is_initialized flag."
    severity: "high"

  - id: "SOL-AUTH-02"
    question: "Are closed accounts properly zeroed and drained?"
    description: "Closing without zeroing data allows account revival when re-funded. The runtime doesn't garbage collect immediately."
    remediation: "Zero all account data AND drain all lamports to a recipient. Use Anchor's close constraint."
    severity: "high"

    question: "Is integer arithmetic protected against overflow in release builds?"
    description: "Rust release builds wrap on integer overflow instead of panicking. This is a common source of Solana vulnerabilities."
    remediation: "Use checked_add, checked_sub, checked_mul, or Anchor's require! with explicit bounds checking."
    severity: "high"
