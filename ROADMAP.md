# Baskerville Roadmap

## Build Phases

### Phase 1: Hound Core Validation
Get Hound running as-is. Configure Claude as strategist. Test on a known vulnerable contract (e.g., Damn Vulnerable DeFi). Validate: ingest → graph → sweep → findings.

**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Completed:**
- ✅ Local model support via LM Studio (LocalModelProvider)
  - JSON extraction from markdown/thinking tags
  - JSON repair for malformed output
  - Auto-detection of localhost URLs
  - Tested with GLM 4.7 flash + Qwen 8B
- ✅ Configured for M4 Max 64GB (GLM flash for scout/strategist, Qwen 8B for lightweight)
- ✅ Tested on Damn Vulnerable DeFi (SideEntrance) - found reentrancy vulnerabilities
- ✅ Full audit cycle on SideEntranceLenderPool:
  - Graph building: Working
  - Sweep mode: Found 5 hypotheses
  - Finalize: Confirmed 2 high-severity (reentrancy), rejected 2 false positives
- ✅ Hypothesis validation working correctly (100% confidence on real vulns)

**Known Issues:**
- Report generation context length issue with local models (prompt too large)
  - Workaround: Use cloud API for reporting, or reduce prompt size

### Phase 2: Static Analysis Pipeline (`extensions/static/`)
Build the static analysis pipeline. Wire Slither and Aderyn output into Hound's hypothesis system.

- `pipeline.py` — Orchestrator that runs tools in sequence: Slither → Aderyn → custom AST patterns
- `slither_runner.py` — Wrapper for Slither (Trail of Bits), parses JSON output into structured findings
- `aderyn_runner.py` — Wrapper for Aderyn (Cyfrin's Rust-based Solidity analyzer)
- `ast_patterns.py` — Custom AST pattern matchers for Solidity-specific patterns the tools miss

Pipeline output feeds into Hound's hypothesis system as initial observations.

**Status:** Planned

### Phase 3: Solodit Integration (`extensions/solodit/`)
Build the Solodit integration. Start with the MCP server bridge (available now), add REST API client when beta access is granted.

- `client.py` — REST API client for Solodit's API (beta access, key via `SOLODIT_API_KEY` env var)
- `mcp_bridge.py` — Integration with the Solodit MCP server (npm package by Lyuboslav Lyubenov) as fallback when API is unavailable
- `cache.py` — Local SQLite cache with text embeddings for offline/fast access to frequently queried findings
- `enricher.py` — Takes Hound hypotheses and cross-references them against Solodit findings to validate, add context, and find similar past vulnerabilities

Two usage modes:
- **Reactive**: When the agent identifies a pattern (e.g., `delegatecall` in proxy), query Solodit for similar past findings
- **Proactive**: Before auditing a protocol category (lending, AMM, vault), pull all related high/critical findings as context

**Status:** Planned

### Phase 4: Knowledge Base (`extensions/knowledge/`)
Build the knowledge base. Structure checklists, create PoC templates, set up vector store.

- `checklists/` — Solodit's 380+ item checklist structured as queryable YAML/JSON, plus custom checklists per protocol category
- `templates/` — Foundry PoC templates by vulnerability class (reentrancy, oracle manipulation, flash loan, access control, logic errors, ERC compliance issues)
- `tips/` — Auditor heuristics and rules
- `embeddings/` — Vector store (ChromaDB) for semantic search over past audits, checklist items, and exploit patterns

**Status:** Planned

### Phase 5: Bounty Workflow (`extensions/bounty/`)
Build the bounty workflow. Contest scrapers, platform formatters, human review gate.

- `scraper.py` — Scrapes contest details (scope files, docs, known issues, timeline) from C4, Sherlock, CodeHawks, Immunefi
- `formatters/` — Platform-specific report formatters:
  - `code4rena.py` — C4 markdown submission format
  - `sherlock.py` — Sherlock submission format
  - `codehawks.py` — CodeHawks format
  - `immunefi.py` — Immunefi bug bounty format
- `submission.py` — Submission preparation with human review gate (never auto-submit)

**Status:** Planned

### Phase 6: CLI Wrapper (`baskerville.py`)
Build the CLI wrapper that ties everything together.

```
baskerville audit <path> --auto                    # Full audit pipeline
baskerville bounty start <contest_url>             # Start contest workflow
baskerville bounty review                          # Review findings before submit
baskerville bounty export --format c4              # Export in platform format
baskerville solodit search <query>                 # Search Solodit DB
baskerville solodit checklist --category lending   # Pull category checklist
baskerville investigate <description> <project>    # Targeted investigation
```

**Status:** Planned

## Solidity-Specific Graph Templates (`extensions/solidity/`)

To be built alongside other phases as needed:

- `erc_patterns.py` — Graph templates for ERC20, ERC721, ERC4626, ERC777 patterns and their known edge cases
- `defi_graphs.py` — Templates for lending protocols, AMMs, vaults, perpetuals, governance
- `proxy_analysis.py` — Proxy pattern detection (UUPS, Transparent, Beacon), storage layout analysis, upgrade safety

## Key Principles

- **Extend, don't rewrite** — Hound's core (graphs, hypotheses, sessions, coverage) is battle-tested. Build on top of it.
- **Human in the loop** — Never auto-submit to bounty platforms. Always require human review.
- **Cache aggressively** — Solodit queries, static analysis results, embeddings. Avoid redundant API calls.
- **Track everything** — Acceptance rates on platforms become the feedback signal for tuning.
- **Solidity-first** — While Hound is language-agnostic, Baskerville optimizes specifically for Solidity/EVM smart contracts.
